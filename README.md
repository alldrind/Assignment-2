## Description

You will do plotting with python. Our goal is to do exploratory data analysis, through visualizing datasets, and to uncover the relations between features in each and understand the statistical relations.

Pick **any 3 datasets** from `plotly.data` and and describe the dataset through visual figures, interactive charts, etc.

You will be presenting your notebook briefly, ideally 5-10 minutes long. 

You can use any python plotting libraries, including:

- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- bokeh
  
## Dataset

You **do not** need to download dataset. Use following code to download the datasets.

``` py
from plotly import data
data.iris()
data.carshare()
data.election()
data.tips()
data.gapminder()
data.wind()
```
